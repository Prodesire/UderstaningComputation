# UderstaningComputation

This repo is the code practicing of the book named [**Understanding Computation**](
http://computationbook.com/). Understanding Computation is a fun and interesting book 
about computation theory, with explanations written in real Ruby code instead of 
mathematical notation.

I implement the concept of the book by two different language, **Ruby** and **Python**. 
So, feel free to read either one of them.
